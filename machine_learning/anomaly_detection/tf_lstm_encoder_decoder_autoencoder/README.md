# tf_encoder_decoder_autoencoder_anomaly_detection

This project is an encoder-decoder autoencoder machine learning model to perform anomaly detection on time-series data such as IoT sensor data or cybersecurity data.

This is mostly an implementation of this research paper: [LSTM-based Encoder-Decoder for Multi-sensor Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1607.00148.pdf).
